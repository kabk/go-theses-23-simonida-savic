				Magic mushrooms, tripping, shrooms, truffles, blue meanies, mushies, are all terms that we might understand in (western) society as synonyms for the psychedelic drug psilocybin. As this topic is becoming more known in the western societies mainstream media more for its beneficial qualities rather than for its old stigma with fear and misconception, there is something interesting happening with the current anatomy of the psychoactive drug in today's context. By starting from a brief overview on this small organism, the mushroom itself, I'd like to dissect and cut the mushroom into different parts: Why would these organisms be important enough to spend our time with, ingesting and sharing new knowledges about them? Where do the psilocybin species come from and when did we start cultivating them in the West?
			</p>

			<p>
				In this thesis I'm interested in the way how mushrooms influence western culture right now, but also where the roots travel back in history. To widen the scope, I'd like to slightly touch upon various aspects, such as the psychoactive medical studies in the early 50's — that were quite important for the development and understanding of the chemical compound that somehow works inside the human brain; how psilocybin can offer us new perspectives, crack open our biggest fears and still offer us enlightenment and a greater sense of consciousness. New doors have been opened for the development of treating mental health problems, that even stretch as far as to outer space. Nowadays’ (western) societies seem to be more exhausted, stressed and detached from their well-being and nurtured minds. I would like to peel each layer from mushroom, unfolding its great presence amongst us, even though sometimes this is still being neglected and overlooked by a negative bias and prejudices within our (western) society.

			People basically love or hate us; we don't see a balance between the

			<p><strong>High in outer space</strong></p>
		
			<p>Imagine the following, that mushrooms are not only relevant on earth
			but that psilocybin mushrooms could also play a greater role in outer
			space: How could we visualize this?<br/>
			<u>Before astronauts are sent into space they must fulfil long periods
			of heavy studies, these include mental and physical tests, specified
			training and overall being prepared for their first time temporarily
			leaving the earth's surface.</u> They are sent up with a top crew
			selected for their mission, each with their own skill set and specialty
			within the astronomic field. But astronauts are human, like you and me
			and most of them will have a family, to say goodbye<br />
			to for a longer period. While having much to do for their mission,
			feelings do still get involved when being shot with a rocket into outer
			space and while having arrived at the assigned destination or space
			station, thoughts could still wonder off to life on earth.<br />
			<br />
			<img src="../go-theses-23-simonida-savic/assets/images/thesis_images/blue_marble_whole_earth_catalogue.jpg" style="width:4.08333in;height:4.08333in" loading="lazy" /><a
			href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><br/>
			<br />
			How can astronauts continue their mission and stay on that mission,
			while having feelings of loneliness, developed trauma or sometimes fear and homesickness? 
			As the extra value comes upon astronauts while looking at <u>the blue
			marble</u><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, the mental well-being of these
			brave space agents is certainly at a risk. When astronauts are traveling
			in space, they could feel lonely, secluded, depressed and sometimes
			traumatized, or in general not feeling good at their mission. As the
			research studies of Stamets<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> show great evidence in
			the benefit of psilocybin mushrooms for our mental health, a new gateway
			or star hole could be opened for the astronauts in space. As Paul
			Stamets told SciAm magazine:<br />
			...“Under carefully controlled conditions, our astronauts [being] able
			to take psilocybin in space and look at the universe and not feel
			distant and alone but feel like they're part of this giant consciousness
			will give them a better frame of mind — psychologically, emotionally —
			to work with other astronauts and stay on mission," Stamets told the
			magazine. "I feel that isolation, loneliness, and depression are going
			to be major issues that astronauts face”...<a href="#fn4"
			class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
			<p>In the article of Dan Robitzski <em>(<u>Neoscope</u>,</em> 3 Aug.
			2021<em>),</em> Stamets talks<br />
			about his research<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> receiving a funding to invest in his
			ideas on global mental health. From this small but very informative article, that also
			talks about astronauts literally being high in space, it also touches upon the
			use and waste of current building materials and potential new investments
			being made for ‘space’ constructions, either build for space stations or
			on planets, made up out of mushrooms or other parts of fungal bodies.
			I'm happy to see new interventions and the deepening of our minds and
			mental well-being, besides from our western jobs that overtime make us
			feel exhausted, sad and sometimes quite terrible physically and eventually mentally as
			well. As psilocybin and other psychedelic drugs are not legal without the
			framing of medical research, the species have been outlawed and considered
			forbidden. Though there might be a possibility that the Dutch
			government<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a><br />
			will invest more in psychedelic studies in the near future!<br />
			<br />
			But how would this be managed? Are we ready for making psilocybin
			into<br />
			a pharmaceutical drug?<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> If this will be a pharmaceutical who
			will have the right to use the substances for health benefits: In what
			kind of proposal are<br />
			we supposed to imagine this? Will it be micro dosed as pharmaceuticals
			that you already can buy legally on online web shops for recreational
			use?<br />
			<br />
			Let’s look on the other side: what would you say if in the next 10-20
			years at least 50% of young people in society are depressed, anxious and
			burned out? Is there actually a danger in expanding this psychedelic
			research, not only for people suffering from mental disorders or severe
			depression, but also the people that have a difficulty with dealing with
			their anxiety or where their work experiences have weighted out in their
			collective emotional trauma?<br />
			What about the people working in the health care system, people that
			need<br />
			to be able to stay professional and distance themselves emotionally to
			be able to do their work? Or would this also be part of the underlying
			pressure of the people working in the health care system, where
			detachment is mandatory<br />
			in order to maintain some sort of mental filter for obtaining that
			“professionality”?</p>

		<p><strong>On eco-anxiety</strong></p>

		<p>As mental health issues are becoming more frequent in Western society
		under people my age and younger generations because of working on high
		demand, always being on –and online available through social media, the
		internet and the pressure of "succeeding” and not being a failure has
		opened a new development for supressed anxiety and stress, just waiting
		around the corner. I hear more and more young people dealing with
		burnouts and the overall exhaustion that has made us look for coping
		mechanisms to sometimes escape reality. Next to our<a href="#fn8"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
		jobs, studies, and occasional<br />
		social activities, also <u>eco-anxiety</u> seems to be a connecting
		factor of fear when we're trying to shape and imagine our futures. The
		term eco-anxiety<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> was used and described as “a chronic
		fear of environmental doom.” by the APA<a href="#fn10"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
		(American Psychological Association) in 2017. Because of heatwaves and
		natural disasters peaked in 2019<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
		id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, the rise of climate
		protest and the reoccurring theme and news items in Western media were
		filled around the worries of climate change. Eco-anxiety has a great
		impact on the mental well-being of people around the world, but this is
		also experienced in differently for each person, depending on where each
		person lives<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>APA: “Changes in climate effect agriculture, infrastructure and
		liveability, which in turn affect occupations and <u>quality of life</u>
		and can force people to migrate.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As daily news items still show: the people that are suffering the
		most are the people that are in close relation to nature and their
		environment – the people that are economically drained and come from
		extracted countries are battling severe droughts, floodings (most recent
		Pakistan, 14 June to October 2022)<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
		id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, water and soil
		pollution in the Brazilian Amazon and Congolese<a href="#fn14"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
		rainforests, and the suffering doesn't stop at people alone: Australian
		wildfires burn mammals alive and catches everything in these natural

		sinkholes<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> spread over the USA, also the food
		supply shortage due to dried out land and harvest failure, and so
		on.<br />
		<br />
		Survey data from youth mental health organisation <em>Reach Out</em>
		measured students from 1595 different schools (14 – 25 y.o.) responding
		to the following statement: “Climate change is going to diminish my
		quality of life<br />
		in the future.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> At least <strong>82%</strong> of
		these students agreed with this statement.</p>

		<p><strong>Humans encountering magic: </strong><p style="color:blue;"> Our ancestors, indigenous knowledge and shamanism</strong></p>
		
		<p>When did we start ingesting magic mushrooms? Scientists and
		researchers are still not quite clear on the answer of the first human ancestors in
		the evolutionary spectrum,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
		id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> where and when
		mind-altering psychedelic<br />
		mushrooms were ingested. Did psilocybin mushrooms play a role in the
		cognitive development of the human brain? The study of Rodríguez and
		Winkelman show a collected theory on the influence of psilocybin
		mushrooms on the social behaviour of early human evolution, originating
		from our ancient ancestors <em>Homonin</em>, in the Pliocene epoch:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>“McKenna (1992) proposed that psilocybin’s effects stimulating visual
		acuity, sexual activity, and ecstatic/visionary experiences influenced
		hominins’ foraging, sensitivity to community, as well as religious and
		spiritual concerns. He also argued the presence of psychedelics in the
		early human diet drove the rapid reorganization of the brain’s
		information-processing capacities by catalyzing the emergence of
		self-reflective consciousness and language. These hypotheses about human
		origins have received little attention and thus still need to be
		examined further.”<br />
		(Arce, Rodríguez, M. José and Winkelman, J. Michael.)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>But how did this small substance influence our evolution, also still
		now<br />
		being able to let the human brain react on this psychoactive drug?<a
		href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a><br />
		There are different methods for preparing and cooking mushrooms. What
		parts do we prepare and what don't we eat? Some species require a
		specific cooking time due to the risk of poisoning<em>.</em> It's also
		very important to distinct safe species over beautiful mushrooms that
		are pretending to be. Foraging mushrooms are always advised to do either
		under guidance of mushroom experts, mycologists, scientists or locals
		that know the area and know the different characteristics between a safe
		and poisonous mushroom.<br />
		<br />
		Mushroom hunting, foraging and collecting mushrooms ourselves has become
		a very popular activity for non-experts like you and me. We must
		consider that the cultivation and ingestion of mushrooms hasn't suddenly
		re-popped up in the West as its origins lay outside of the European
		border<br />
		and has been re-invented in Western modern medicine by Albert Hoffman<a
		href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, starting from the synthesizing
		process of “lysergic acid diethylamide in 1938”<a href="#fn20"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>,
		also known as LSD. This is a "synthetic chemical” that is made<br />
		from the infection of rye grain that the fungi <em>Ergot</em> causes in
		this process. Hoffman didn't know of the psychoactive properties
		until<br />
		5 years after his lab experiment in 1938<a href="#fn21"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>.</p>
		<p>When we dive in one of these ancient histories<a href="#fn22"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>,
		there is an example of an early indigenous community, The Chimú culture,
		which shows mushroom representation and "mushroom knowledge". These
		artworks would be made from bronze, gold, ceramic, textile and stone.
		The Chimú culture dates to early 900-1470 CE, Peru.</p>
		<p><img src="assets/images/thesis_images/Chimu_Tumi_Knife_12th_to_15thC.jpg" style="width:3.8648in;height:5.625in" /></p>

		</a>Accessed 5 Dec. 2022<br />
		<br />
		In the figure above you see a ceremonial knife, also known as Tumi, that
		contains characteristics of mushroom relating to the Chimú society,
		Peru,<br />
		to their religious aspects and beliefs<a href="#fn23"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>.
		This artifact is an example of many other objects that could have been
		used for ancient rituals, rites and ceremonies. This could be connected
		to the beliefs that embody, respect and honour nature's presence. The
		Chimú people would adapt their way of living to nature and to their
		natural living environments, whereas the epistemology of a capitalised
		western society would either destroy, outsource and separate the nature
		out of the human body<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>

		</blockquote>
	
		<p>In the findings of Trutmann, there is no specification of the Chimú
		people and their relation to psilocybin mushrooms. But there are
		findings that indicate that the Moche people or other indigenous
		societies (the Paracas)<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> used the psilocybe species in their
		lives and practices. As psilocybin mushrooms were used for spiritual
		development and used in sacred context, rituals and ceremonies were
		built around the psychedelic experiences. These findings have been
		documented in Mayan and the surviving language of Popul Vuh<a
		href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>.<br />
		<br />
		As Trutmann states: <em>“We now know Peruvian ancestors were highly
		expressive in representing mushrooms in ceramics, textiles and sculpture
		representing them either realistically, or stylistically or
		symbolically.</em>”</p>

		<p>Would you believe me that the chemical compound, psilocybin in these

		any addictive drugs we already know? While having the knowledge that
		XTC, alcohol, nicotine, Marijuana (weed), benzoyl-methyl-ecgonine

		As the stigma around psychedelics have been slowly dissolving, fears and

		psychedelics being accepted by more people in western society<a
		href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"

		<br />
		Psilocybin is the alkaloid found within magic mushrooms. This chemical
		enhances –and functions as an amplifier for hallucinative experiences.
		Psilocybin is an alkaloid or chemical compound found in the
		<em>psilocybe</em> species. <em>Psilocin</em> is the most active
		substance that is produced by the metabolic<a href="#fn28"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
		process of psilocybin. There are approximately around 116 species known
		and registered psilocybin species, growing at any place in the world.
		This potentially could be around the edges and trails of tropical
		forests or even across your local police station<a href="#fn29"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>.
		What exactly happens in our brain when we ingest psilocybin? How does
		are brain change the space between neurones while being on high on this
		psychedelic drug?<br />
		In 1958 at the Sandoz<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"

		(Geiger, et al. p2440, scheme 2: Synthisizing process of Psilocybin,

		<br />
		Once the drug is ingested, it will be absorbed and will start the

		Psilocin enters the bloodstream without any struggles, travels and
		enters the systemic circulation<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref"

		Neurons within our <em>connectome,</em> the mapping of all neural

		role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> of consciousness as the drug
		becomes psychoactive and hallucinations start to form.<br />

		role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> As psilocybin uses up a lot of the

		<p><strong>The cauldron of storytelling:</strong> <br/> <p style="color:blue;">witches brew and psychedelic
		representations</p>
		<p>We cannot go around it, but the mushroom is everywhere - even in the
		imaginary worlds. Fiction is intertwined with the connections and
		representation of mushrooms with fantasy figures and fictional
		characters<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>.<br />
		Although these visual representations of the mushroom can not only be
		found in Western Europe, parts in Siberia and Scandinavia (Dugan, p29
		&amp; p38)<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> show similarities and traces back
		of the dominance the Fly Agaric has in these regions. When thinking back
		to my own childhood, this is also one of the mushrooms I can think of
		that would have been prominently used in fairy tales: In a forest
		surrounded by magical creatures. Therefor the connections we can make
		from mushroom in relation to these fictional characters are kind of
		inevitable and hard to overlook. You can think of gnomes and leprechauns
		sitting on the caps of mushrooms or even use them as little houses,
		animals that would live in the forest alongside trolls, fairies or
		<u>witches</u> that would use various mushrooms to create potions or
		mysterious brews.<br />
		As a kid I was always in love with the imaginary worlds that I could
		spend<br />
		my time with, and ever more so being excited to be able to delve into
		these characters. Unfortunately, as we get older, we come to understand
		that these “original” fairy tales relate to horrifying folktales<a
		href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> that scare and warn people with a
		deeper and inner rooted metaphor. Where strangers, out standers, people
		with disabilities and women have been demonized and were often portrayed
		as utterly evil.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>You’re most present in the light,<br />
		at the same time, we roam in the dark.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As the representation of mushrooms have also been widely connected to
		witches, either as part of their potion brews or special species they
		maintain in their mystical garden, the image of the witch goes beyond
		the Western European fairy tales. Art and illustrations of the fantasy
		figure riding on brooms, the making of mysterious potions, they are
		either presented as an old and scary hag or a young and seductive
		woman.<br />
		According to Federici's<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> work on <em>Witches, Witch-hunting
		and Women</em>, <em>Caliban and the Witch: Women the Body and Primitive
		Accumulation</em>, et al., the accusing and the forming of the term
		<em>witch</em> derives<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> from the extensive torturing and
		killing of innocent people, predominantly women, but also queer and gay
		people, people of colour, comes from the witch-hunt that already dates
		back around 3 centuries. From 15<sup>th</sup>, moreover in the
		16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century, witch-hunting was something
		practiced very commonly, and this range of terror and extreme torture
		ended in Europe near the 18<sup>th</sup> century. One of the biggest
		misconceptions on the figure of the witch, that originates from Western
		Europe, is that there weren't any major witch-hunts in the start of the
		Middle Ages. This was something that developed later, near the end of
		the 15<sup>th</sup> century, where we're somewhere in the middle of the
		Middle Ages.</p>
		<p>But who were those so-called witches? Silvia argued that there is a
		clear connection between the witch-hunting and the political and social
		transformations that were taking place in Western Europe. This also
		went<br />
		in hand with “the development of the capitalist economy.” This was also
		the beginning of slave trade and colonization in the 16<sup>th</sup> C.
		— “conquest of American territories” and the beginning of the capitalist
		world.”</p>
		<p>During the development of this new economic system and overruling
		existence of the patriarchy, society needed a figure to blame when
		misfortune would happen and where the reasons of this misfortune would
		be impossible to explain or figure out at that time. Silvia: “They would
		be accused of supernatural powers and for unfortune, that couldn't be
		solved.”<br />
		“Bizarre accusations were made such as: 'witches' would be making poison
		with their bodies.” <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Federici: “</strong>After the torture, the accused, innocent
		people would be burned at the<br />
		stake, being a quite known method in<br />
		Europe for witch persecutions<strong>.” (33:28 – 36:00)</strong></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The female body was seen as “a working machine” that would only
		benefit society in the form of sexual reproduction and labour. Next to
		labelling and accusing women (who for instance weren't married with
		children), also queer and gay people, folk healers and Indigenous people
		and their communities became part of the new target of which the
		patriarchy has set his eyes on.<br />
		Women were not allowed to express their sexual power, their desires, so
		far that not even just their love and “collective spirit” of female
		friendship (where the sharing of thoughts, ideas and feelings) was seen
		as a threat and danger and were seen as untrustworthy, suspicious, and
		wrong.</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Federici: “</strong>The scandal of the witch,<br />
		the portraying, the witch hunt has been thrown in the dustbin of
		history. The witch has been transformed into a legendary figure, a
		figure<br />
		of fantasy, <strong>…“</strong>the history of these persecutions is
		being erased”… And has been transformed into a capitalist use of the
		figure of the witch<strong>.”</strong></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Next to the story of witch-hunting and the origin of Western European
		witches, the visual representation really shows how men viewed women in
		society. From and throughout the 15<sup>th</sup> C. illustrations and
		woodcuts<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> would be depicting and translating
		the patriarchal gaze by demonizing and sexualizing women's bodies
		through the medium of the witch. Seen as a demonic creature, often nude
		with strange habits, for instance riding backwards on goats and flying
		on broomsticks.</p>

		<p><strong>Poisoning and weaponization of psychoactive
		drugs</strong><br />
		<br />
		As we already know that psychedelic plants and fungi have been
		used<br />
		by Indigenous communities for medical practices and healing rituals for
		centuries, the substances used for medical studies and therapies
		didn't<br />
		enter Western modern medicine until Hofmann's study in 1938,<br />
		see <em><u>Ingesting Mushrooms: Our ancestors, indigenous knowledge and
		shamanism</u></em>, (note 26 &amp; 27)</p>
		<p>After his first accidental testing of LSD, in between 1940 and 1970<a
		href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> experiments and research studies
		have tested psychedelics for offering<br />
		new medical approaches to mental disorders, depression, PTSD,
		alcoholism, anxiety disorders, etc. But Hofmann wasn't the first to
		introduce psychedelic medicine to modern Western pharmacy. Already in
		<u>1895</u> Prentiss and Morgan (US) documented the healing practices
		and ceremonial rites in “Central America” of the psychedelic effects of
		Mescaline<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>.<br />
		In <u>1958</u> Hofmann synthesized ‘psilocybe’, a deriving alkaloid of
		magic mushrooms (see note 35, <em>Sandoz</em>). Before the escape of
		psychoactive substances from laboratories entering non-scientific
		settings in the 60's<br />
		and 70's, other drugs and psychoactive substances have been widely used
		during war times<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>, such as the Vietnam war in 1955,
		also known as the “pharmacological war” - lasting for at least 20
		years<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Lukasz Kamienski:</strong> ..."by the end of the
		1960s...<br />
		“The dark side of psychedelics began to receive tremendous amounts of
		publicity— bad trips, psychotic breaks, flashbacks, suicides—and
		beginning in 1965 the exuberance surrounding these new drugs gave way to
		moral panic. As quickly as the culture and the scientific establishment
		had embraced psychedelics, they now turned sharply against them.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Because drugs (including psychedelics) came in touch with the
		counterculture in 1960, there is also a dark side to the uses of these
		substances starting from that era. As there were no policies from
		pharmaceutical companies who were “offering synthesized psychoactives”<a
		href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> to researchers on the condition of
		sharing the results of these studies.<br />
		As psychedelics didn't have an instruction manual, people were
		using<br />
		them recklessly and basically anyone could get their hands on these
		drugs,<br />
		using them without prescription, in non-safe environments<a href="#fn50"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>.<br />
		While the civil rights movement, war protests, African American civil
		rights movement and the second feminism wave developing from the 1960's,
		in 1971 Nixon<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> declared a national “war on drugs”
		and signed the drug law enforcement on 28 Jan. 1972. Even though the war
		on drugs was there to solve a “national emergency”, there was a “full
		scale moral panic” (Pollan 24:50-24:56) of the adult generation on the
		youth of America;<br />
		the Vietnam war was also a factor to move the drug law enforcement of
		72’ forward, mainly because of the drug addicted soldiers it had
		created.<br />
		<br />
		But the war on drugs was also designed to discriminate and set as a
		political strategy to demonize and criminalize people from different
		races and ethnicities, and mostly just from being black. By
		criminalizing a specific group in society, it shows the fear and overall
		malice of Nixon's mark on American politics to the criminalization of
		black people. As the war on drugs was generally failing, the US
		government was looking for a scapegoat in society, but more importantly,
		Nixon tried to cover his scandals<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref"
		id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> and mistakes<br />
		of his time in the office.<br />
		<br />
		A new report by Dan Baum for Harper's Magazine: <strong>John Ehrlichman
		(1994)</strong></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>"<em>The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House</em><br />
		<em>after that, had two enemies: the anti-war left and black people. You
		understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be
		either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate
		the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then
		criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could
		arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and
		vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were
		lying about the drugs? Of course we did.</em>"</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>While those communities of black people and Hispanics<a href="#fn53"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>
		were targeted<br />
		(and still are by today), 1980's Hollywood<a href="#fn54"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
		was praised for the use of crack cocaine. Barack Obama (8:46): “It's not
		normal for black and Latino youth<br />
		to go through the system in this way.” ... “This is not normal.”<br />
		There is a huge link to the “violent” arrestment's we see in the news
		and media almost every day, where innocent black people are being
		targeted<br />
		and where the police are always looking for a “drug involvement”<a
		href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> — so that those police officers,
		who are guilty of violent arrests and the killing of black people, can
		find a way and excuse to justify their actions while being in service
		and duty of the American Law Enforcement<a href="#fn56"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>.<br />
		<br />
		Slowly from the 90's, small groups<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref"
		id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> of scientists and
		psychotherapists still believed in the potential benefits of studying
		and testing psychoactives for mental health therapies and this slowly
		developed into the rebirth of psychedelics nowadays, also known as “The
		Psychedelic Renaissance”.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref"

		<p><strong>Our <em>unexpected</em> close relatives</strong></p>
		<p>What are mushrooms – and how does humankind relate to them?<br />
		Somewhat mysterious, envied and still misunderstood, these amazing,
		intelligent and extraordinary organisms are often connected to negative
		stereotypes of being dirty and unimportant.</p>
		<p>Consisting of a cap<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> with gills, filled with spores that
		release and travel<br />
		by wind for expanding their kin on big geographical distances. What are
		mushrooms? Basically, a fungus itself, a mushroom is considered the
		fruit of the fungal body made of the same materials as the roots growing
		underneath the soil, <em>mycelium.</em> When we look closer to the
		microscopic thin threads, they consist of rooted structures, the
		<em>hyphae</em>. Mushrooms are made of these hyphae and are the
		reproductive organ of the fungi.Not all fungi produce mushrooms, and they can also be classified
		into sub-species: poisonous, medicinal, invading or even symbiotic
		species.
		When we look at the cell structure of mushrooms, we see that these
		eukaryotic<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> organisms are very different from
		the cell structure of plants.<br />
		As fungi have a special and very own kingdom of species, not belonging
		to the plant or mammal kingdom, we humans, share the same evolutionary
		cell characters as fungi. Also, fungal behaviours are very similar to
		our human-social-interactions.</p>

		<p><strong>Eukaryotic body, multispecies and symbiotic
		relations</strong><br />
		<br />
		Fungi share similarities with us in social behaviour, survival instincts
		and collaboration. But these similarities are even literally on a
		cellular level.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a><br />
		Did you know that mushrooms are closer related to humans than to
		plants?<br />
		In the <em>biological field</em>, regna and their species can be
		divided<br />
		in 3 domains: <em><u>Bacteria</u></em><a href="#fn62"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>,
		<em><u>Archaea</u></em> and <em><u>Eukaryotic</u></em>.</p>
		<p>Animals, plants, algae or fungus are eukaryotic organisms and share
		therefore also “the long-lasting intimacy of strangers”<a href="#fn63"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>.
		This evolutionary theory is based on the symbiosis of organisms and not
		on the interpretation we also know of the Darwin<a href="#fn64"
		class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>
		evolution theory, where survival of the fittest reflects similarly to
		the competitive nature of the capitalised western society. What makes
		this story so interesting and relevant to us, is that is based on most
		of the significant moments<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref"
		id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> in the evolution. It
		shows the convergence, collaboration, coming together and staying
		together of different organisms. (1967, <em>Lynn Margulis,</em> US
		biologist)<br />
		We could call this coming together and sticking together of species
		symbiosis. As mammals and fungi are both Eukaryotic organisms, our cell
		structure is even almost alike<em>.</em> Could mushrooms help us find
		the answers we're looking for? And could fungi be the actual dominating
		species on earth?</p>
		<p>The term originates from the former Botanist Anton DeBary in 1873 and
		the idea of symbiogenisis has been invented by Konstantin Berezovsky
		(1855-1921), which can be understood as "the living together of very
		different kinds of organisms.” Margulis: “In some situation (I think
		over the course of evolution) this shared living, collaboration came
		from sharing the habitats, leading to living and sticking together. This
		process can be understood as symbiogenisis.” Lynn is aware of her
		different approach and belief on evolution hence she had to stand her
		ground to other leading figures not taking her different take on
		evolution theory seriously. <strong>Margulis:</strong><br />
		“Appearance of new bodies, new organs, new species.” (p43, ch3)<a

		<p>Another scholar who supports this theory is Donna Haraway<a
		href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>: she wrote<br />
		the Camille stories<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> to speculate about on a different
		future for our earthly survival, a way to break down the barrier that
		has been put by the western capitalist driven minds between people and
		nature. The Camille Stories were a way for Haraway to explain her theory
		on making kin and not babies. Making kin can be understood as not only
		the living and interacting of multispecies — going beyond the human
		species world that has been created and finding the relations with and
		through “nature”. Not making babies, in the sense that love and care are
		not only running through blood, but they can also be expanded from the
		current westernized human understanding of the natural environment that
		focuses on the separation of human, nature and other species. The
		reproduction of the human species shouldn't be the only solution to give
		love and care, to share and gain knowledge alone. Haraway is breaking
		the paths we take as human individuals and she's allowing us to
		reimagine future aspects of our earthly world, by looking for solutions
		beyond the human centred world and sees multispecies as the intersection
		of symbionts not only working and cooperating, but also by love and
		care,<br />
		trying to preserve multispecies habitat and sustain balance by
		speculating on symbiogenisis of human and animal. Haraway
		(21:05–22:05):<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>“<em>Camille is a symbiont put together by the biological operations
		of sym (yoking) bio (living) genesis (beginnings). Symbiogenisis, bio
		from linking. Only humans can take on the flesh of their symbionts to be
		able to do their job better, see better, able to taste the air better.
		To see things differently</em>.”</p>

		<p><strong>The soils’ multi-universe: mother of
		ecosystems</strong><br />
		<br />
		Next to human relations with fungi, plants too share a profound
		symbiosis,<br />
		in order to survive, thrive and “involve” with one another (Meyers and
		Hustak)<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"
		role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>. This relation and long-lasting

		<blockquote>
		<p><strong>(Sheldrake, p137):</strong> Mycorrhizal fungi can provide up
		to <strong>80%</strong> of a plant’s nitrogen and as much as a hundred
		percent of its phosphorus.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>These relations between plant and fungi can be understood as quite a
		fluid process and an open exchange, depending on where plants grow and
		what type of species are able to interact with existing types of fungi.
		This type of relationship between plants and fungi is also known as a
		"mycorrhizal relationship.” Fungi make sure the soil is fertile: holding
		and spreading water they give to plants; they also give and exchange
		nutrients like "zinc” and “copper.” Within this exchange, fungi take up
		30% of the carbon that's being submerged by plants and get sugars in
		return by the process of photosynthesis of the plant. Without the
		involvement of fungi in the soil,<br />
		landscapes would face severe droughts and wouldn't be able to hold and
		absorb any water. This relation of exchange doesn't really have a power
		play, between both plants and fungi, as neither of them are in control
		within this relationship, they negotiate the possibilities of this
		exchange depending on what they could offer one another. Though there
		are some fungal species that are less communal and collect large
		supplies of “phosphorus” they can find in this relationship.</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p><strong>(Sheldrake p146): “</strong>Fungi can determine which plants
		grow where; they can even drive the evolution of new species by
		isolating plant populations from one another.”</p>

		<li id="fn64"><p>In an interview written by Suzan Mazur, Lynn Margulis
		explains why the Darwin evolution theory should be considered “dead” and
		not be a solid piece of scientific research that we can apply to
		understanding the lineages of different species, as there is no
		“adequate evidence in literature” that is documented and can explain the
		sudden mutations that would result into a new species. There is an
		excessive number of high-quality studies that has shown no doubt that
		“symbiogenisis” would be at the very basis of the origin of species or a
		group of one or more populations of organisms. The long-lasting intimacy
		of strangers: symbiogenisis.<br />
		<br />
		Maybe to understand this visually, people from Gen-Z and the alpha
		generation could think of how Pokémon would evolve sort of magically
		into a newer version of that same species. The theory of symbiosis shows
		theory and more steps that could explain the steps in between the
		evolution of new species.</p>

		endosymbiosis theory' was published after fifteen or so assorted
		rejections and losses of an early, painfully convoluted, and poorly
		written manuscript. Called 'Origin of Mitosing Cells,' it was finally
		accepted for publication in 1966 through the personal intervention of
		James F. Danielli, then editor of the daring Journal of Theoretical
		Biology. Of course, the article when it appeared in print in late 1967,
		carried my first married name Lynn, Sagan. The theory was dubbed SET,
		the acronym for Serial Endosymbiosis Theory (not to be confused with
		SETI - the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence), by another
		protist aficionado, Professor Max Taylor of the University of British
		Colombia, Vancouver.” p38-p40 The Symbiotic Planet: A New View of

		(<strong>Lynn Margulis</strong>, p.40): “SET is a theory of coming
		together, of merging of cells of different histories and abilities.
		Before serial endosymbiosis and the establishment of the aerobic
		nucleated cell, no cell-fusion sex existed. Meiotic sex, like of the egg
		fertilized by the sperm, came later. Serial endosymbiosis made our kind
		of fusion sex possible. Sex, too, is the coming together, the merging of
